# 1. make sure you have request imported from the flask library
# 2. make sure you are using POST so you allow for data to be sent with the request
# 3. You need a global var that will be checked on subsequent requests to make sure they are done post autherisation
# 4. Need to update the other requests to check that a valid token has been autherised

## Extra challenge: how would you make a 'refresh token'?
